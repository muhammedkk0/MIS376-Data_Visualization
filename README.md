### Introduction

#### The COVID-19 virus, which emerged in China and spread all over the world, has literally become a global threat and has been described as an epidemic by the World Health Organization. Apart from China, it is observed that the virus, which has spread to many European countries such as the United States, Canada and Germany, also negatively affects international business life. Although many of the developed countries have overcome these effects with vaccination, their effects are still strong. In this study, the effects of Corona Virus on the import and export of goods and services of countries that play an important role in world trade will be examined.
### Definition of the Problem
