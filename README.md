#### In this study 2 different data sets were used. First, the number of daily cases seen in Turkey from 2020-03-11 to 2021-05-21, the number of daily patients, the number of daily tests, the number of daily deaths, and the number of patients recovering daily were taken into consideration. In the second data set, the total amount of vaccines administered to Turkey from 2021-01-13 to 2021-05-22 was taken into account. The data sets are taken from the site named https://ourworldindata.org/. Since this site contains the data of all countries of the world, it has been reduced to Turkey only and unnecessary columns have been removed. The first data set consists of 436 rows and 6 columns, while the second contains 128 rows and 4 columns.
