## The Effect of the Corona Virus on the Import and Export of Products and Services in the World
### Introduction
---
#### The COVID-19 virus, which emerged in China and spread all over the world, has literally become a global threat and has been described as an epidemic by the World Health Organization. Apart from China, it is observed that the virus, which has spread to many European countries such as the United States, Canada and Germany, also negatively affects international business life. Although many of the developed countries have overcome these effects with vaccination, their effects are still strong. Despite the corona virus emerging in China, the corona virus, which has caused great effects and transformations in the world, has not only affected China but also the economy of many countries in the world. As an example, let's assume that two firms trade between China and Turkey. Considering that one of these companies is in the quarantine zone. This situation will affect the deliveries of the companies and correctly the supply chain. It can be said that many situations like this affect the economy of countries in general. In this study, the effects of Corona Virus on the import and export of goods and services of countries that play an important role in world trade will be examined.
### Definition of the Problem

#### The coronavirus epidemic has caused great losses and problems in many areas such as social, economic, sports, tourism, education and political. According to research, it is thought that it will cause a loss of 1.7 trillion dollars in the tourism industry alone. In addition, there seems to be an especially foreign and domestic trade effect. Especially the introduction of internal and external restrictions caused many problems, especially the supply chain. In this study, it will be observed how domestic and foreign trade between countries is affected. In particular, how goods and services affect the import and export balance of countries.
